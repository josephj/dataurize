Using DataURI instead of binary images is a very good idea in web development.
One binary image means an extra HTTP request in your request.
It's easy to have 30+ images on a single page, which means you have 30+ HTTP requests.
The more requests means the poor performance of your website. 

A common solution to this is using CSS sprites to combine multiple images into one.
However, the maintainance cost of choosing this apporach is really expensive. 
You always have to use some huge drawing software like Photoshop or Fireworks to maintain.
And carefully using background-position, overflow: hidden, width, and height CSS attributes to make it work.
A engineering industry shouldn't have such ridiculous process.

DataURI transforms images to Base64 encodeed string.
That means you have see a image without any HTTP Request.
Though the file size blows to 2 to 3 times larger, GZip makes it worthy of the investment.
And remember request is expensive than file size in most situation.

The only thing we need to overcome is browser compatibility issues.
Internet Explorer version before 8 doesn't support DataURI.
However, something similar called MHTML can achieve the same effect.

dataurize, the shell script transforms your CSS files into ones using DataURI and MHTML.
And you don't have to worry about browser compatibility issue of course.
Just one command, you can say goodbye to CSS sprites!
